Minestuck+
=======

Minestuck+ is an addon mod for [Minestuck](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minestuck), which intends to be a source of additional, non-serious content.
Such content currently is several "disguises," weapons, and a (very impractical) modus.

Features:
=======
Currently, the mod adds:

- Grist costs for pre-existing Minecraft items that previously did not have them.
- Beaglepusses (beaglepi?) - A silly disguise for any aspiring prankster.
- Weapons: A collection of weapons both drawing from other games as well as creative combinations of vanilla Minecraft items.
- Shields: 2 (actually useful) shields that give either enhanced knockback or the chance to steal your opponent's weapon!
- Roulette Modus: A more convoluted way to collect your items, since every fetch *might* not give you the item!
- Armor Trims: There is an armor trim for every aspect, as well as a general spirogram themed trim.
- Armor Materials: You can now use raw cruxite, uranium, and bi-dye to trim armor.
- Placeable plushies of both consort and scalemate varieties.

Mod Compat(s):
=======
- Grist costs for [Farmer's Delight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/farmers-delight) and [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) mod items.
- Farmer's Delight cabinets for every Minestuck wood type.
- Minestuck knives now work as tools for the Farmer's Delight cutting board.
- A new chainsaw and hammer utilizing Create mod items.
