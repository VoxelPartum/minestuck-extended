Minestuck+
=======

Minestuck+ is an addon mod for Minestuck developed by mraof, which intends to be a source of additional, non-serious content.
Such content currently is several "disguises," two weapons, and a (very impractical) modus.

Features:
============
Currently, the mod adds:

- Beaglepusses (beaglepi?) - A silly disguise for any aspiring prankster.
- Weapons: Two weapons from someone closely associated to Homestuck...
- Roulette Modus: A more tedious way to collect your items, since every fetch *might* not give you the item!

Planned Features:
------------
- Weapons/items for cross-mod compatibility.
- Placeable plushies.
